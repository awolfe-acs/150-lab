1. Our terminal is powershell, so use powershell commands.
   Do not use Unix-shell shorthand commands, they will fail.

2. Avoid inserting control characters as text (^D, ^C).

To simulate those behaviors in PowerShell scripts or commands:
Use exit to leave the shell.
Use Ctrl+C manually if interrupting is needed.
Don’t type q unless it’s a valid command.

3. If I used the term `scrub` in chat, this is likely referring to an entire span of scroll time of a GSAP ScrollTrigger (start and end time), not the ScrollTrigger `scrub` property itself.
