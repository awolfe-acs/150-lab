Our terminal is powershell, so use powershell commands.
Do not use Unix-shell shorthand commands, they will fail.

Avoid inserting control characters as text (^D, ^C).

To simulate those behaviors in PowerShell scripts or commands:

Use exit to leave the shell.

Use Ctrl+C manually if interrupting is needed.

Don’t type q unless it’s a valid command.
